## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My name is Yadiel Mercado Rivera from the town of Morovis, P.R. I am a student of the UPRRP and I am studying in the undergraduate baccalaureate of Computer Sciences, currently in my third year of University but classified as a second year student. I find myself taking the High-Level languages course primarily because it is required for me to be able to graduate and secondly because I personally would love to be pushed out of my comfort zone with C++ and get my hands dirty with other programming languages similar to C++.

### Work Experience

I haven't any actual paid work experience in the field of computer sciences as of today, however outside of the field I find myself working as a part-time dish washer in a mexican themed restaurant in Dorado [maybe add more information]
