## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My name is Yadiel Mercado Rivera from the town of Morovis, P.R. I am a student of the UPRRP and I am studying in the undergraduate baccalaureate of Computer Sciences, currently in my third year of University but classified as a second year student. I find myself taking the High-Level languages course primarily because it is required for me to be able to graduate and secondly because I personally would love to be pushed out of my comfort zone with C++ and get my hands dirty with other programming languages similar to C++.

### Work Experience

Currently, I work as a dishwasher in the restaurant.  My responsibilities are not limited to the cleaning dishes, prepare both drink and meal ingredients, prepare main course dishes, work the storage and deliver food in Dorado.


### Education

During my course of study, I have become familiar with different planning strategies such as pseudocode and flowcharts. I have around 3 years of experience in C++ having worked with data structures. Overall, I am familiar with both project management & documentation and programming.
Introduction to Computer Science, Introduction to Computer Programming, Data Structures.
Stacks, Queues, Files, Binary Trees, Maps.
